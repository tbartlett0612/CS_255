•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project was DriverPass. The system that they were looking to have built was an online application that provided access to online classes, practice test, downloadable materials, and a way to register for on-the-road training.

•	What did you do particularly well? 

I feel I did a great job with the business requirements document. After revising my initial attempt of filling out the document, I feel I was able to capture what the client wanted and was able to translate the wants and needs into system requirements.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part to revise from these documents, it would be the diagrams from project 2. I feel I did not give adequate attention to this part, and feel these could have been better. I would go back over them while reviewing proper notation for each diagram, and make sure each were following best practices. One diagram in particular I would want to go over again would be the Use Case diagram, as I feel I still did not capture the needed parts of the system for this diagram.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was able to interpret the user's needs through interviewing the client and coming up with the technical requirements based on what the client says the system should be able to do. After these requirements are made, use cases can be designed to start to show what the system will look like in the end. The user's needs are important to consider when designing a system because they are the ones who the system is being created for. In this case, DriverPass may be the client, but it is the end user that the system is being built for.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Currently the only coding I do is for classes, so I don’t really have a set approach to designing software. I do feel that the approach that was used during this class is a very effective process. Having a meeting with the client where questions can be asked to find out what they would like the system to be able to do, if they have an idea as to how the system should look, and most importantly what the purpose of the system is. This leads to being able to come up with the requirements and document them. From this a Use Case diagram, Activity and Sequence Diagrams, and a UML Class diagram can be made which gives you (and possibly a team) an overview of what the system is to look like from a coding standpoint.
